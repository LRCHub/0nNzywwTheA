Storm blew a tree down in my backyard
My axe wouldn't cut it and my saw wouldn't start
Good excuse for a trip to the hardware store
To give that little hottie workin' a thrill de' jour
I know that she digs me 'cause when I walked in
Here she come a runnin' with a can I help you grin
Like a puppy on a leash she followed me around
I left her droolin' at the mouth when I walked out

Chorus:
But I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my Liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there

I'm pretty sure she meant to drop that can of W.D.
So I could see her bend over in her tight blue jeans
I was eye to eye with Taz and a Tweety tattoo
Forced to play a little game of peek-a-boo
Then she led me down the aisle by the pipe and glue
Asked me if I had any plumbing to do
Hands planted firm on the curve of her hip
Looked to me like she was lookin' for a little lip to lip

Chorus:
But I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my Liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there

She even did that little finger thingy through her hair
Practically undressed me with her Playboy stare
I gave her back that look that she was lookin' for
I think that she forgot that we was in that store

Chorus:
But I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my Liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there

Yeah I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my Liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there
